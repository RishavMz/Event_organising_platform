This repo has been made for keeping tracks of changes and version control for our web based application.
    
    Project Description:
        A platform where people organising events online can connect with the registered students .
        This is a website where various organisers(from one or different institutes) can list their event with necessary details and               registration details. 
        Students can see all the events organised by various events (including ongoing events, past events and upcoming events)                     and register in an event if they wish. The organiser can see the registrations for their events. 
        Also, there exists admin access, where the admin can see all the events irganised by different organisers , and all participating           and registered students. There also exists comment section for each indivisual event for queries and answers.
